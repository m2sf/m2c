Changes to the Language Specification since 2021


(1) Clarified declaration and definition nomenclature.

A declaration states that an entity exists.

A definition defines an entity.

To be consistent, the proper nomenclature requires
a change of the syntax for the module headers of
so called 'definition' modules to either declaration
or interface modules. Since their primary purpose is
that of interface, they are renamed to interface
modules and their module header syntax changed to

INTERFACE MODULE Ident;

The associated file type is ".if" but the
all-caps representation ".IF" is also permissible.

The previous file type ".def" and its all-caps
represenation ".DEF" are NOT supported.


(2) Removed POINTER from OPAQUE type constructor.

Use OPAQUE alone instead of OPAQUE POINTER.


(3) Restricted use of OCTETSEQ to formal type only.

Use of PROCEDURE P ( arg : CAST OCTETSEQ ) is legal,
but RECORD field : OCTETSEQ; ... END is illegal.


(4) Changed attributes in binding specifiers.

Use reserved words instead of single characters:

PROCEDURE [NEW+] NewWithArgs ( ... );

=> PROCEDURE [NEW ARGLIST] NewWithArgs ( ... );

PROCEDURE [NEW#] NewWithCapacity ( ... );

=> PROCEDURE [NEW CAPACITY] NewWithCapacity ( ... );

PROCEDURE [READ*] ReadNew ( ... );

=> PROCEDURE [READ NEW] ReadNew ( ... );

HOWEVER, the single character attribute '#' for
formatted writing remains:

PROCEDURE [WRITE #] WriteF ( ... );

This maps 1:1 to the WRITE statement syntax

WRITE #("5;2", amount);

and its use in the binding is thus intuitive.


(5) removed syntax for universal set {*}

Use {TMIN(ValueType)..TMAX(ValueType)} instead.
