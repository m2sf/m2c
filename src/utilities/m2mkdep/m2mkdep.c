 * M2C is a portable  Modula-2 to C translator  and  via-C compiler  for the *
 * bootstrap subset of the revised Modula-2 language described in            *
 *                                                                           *

 * In translator mode,  M2C translates Modula-2 source files to semantically *
 * equivalent C source files.  In compiler mode,  it translates the Modula-2 *
 * source files  to C,  then compiles the resulting C sources  to object and *
 * executable files using the host system's resident C compiler and linker.  *
 *                                                                           *
