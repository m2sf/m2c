## M2C â€” A C-hosted Modula-2 to C Translator Project ##
Welcome to the M2C Modula-2 to C Translator Project


### Objective ###

The objective of this project is to develop a via-C bootstrap compiler for the revised Modula-2 language described in

[*Modula-2 Revision 2010, Language Report for the Bootstrap Kernel Subset (BSK)*, by Kowarsch and Sutcliffe, July 2020](https://github.com/m2sf/PDFs/blob/master/M2BSK%20Language%20Description.pdf).


### Grammar ###

The grammar of M2C's command line interface is in the project repository

https://github.com/m2sf/m2c/blob/main/grammar/cli-grammar.gll

The grammar of M2C's input language is in the project repository

https://github.com/m2sf/m2c/blob/main/grammar/m2c-grammar.gll

For a graphical representation of the grammar, see section
[Syntax Diagrams](https://github.com/m2sf/m2bsk/wiki/Language-Specification-(D)-:-Syntax-Diagrams).


### Language Specification ###

An online version of the language specification is here:

https://github.com/m2sf/m2bsk/wiki/Language-Specification


The authoritative language specification (PDF) is available for download:

### Scope ###

M2C supports the Bootstrap Kernel (BSK) **subset** of Modula-2 R10.

For a list of facilities that have been omitted in the subset, see [Omissions](https://github.com/m2sf/m2bsk/wiki/Omissions).

**M2C does not support the earlier PIM or ISO dialects.**

For a PIM Modula-2 translator see the [M2T project](https://github.com/trijezdci/m2t).


### Targets ###

M2C will generate C99 sources compileable with any C compiler that supports the C99 standard.


### License ###

M2C is licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL) both v.2.1 and v.3.


### Prerequisites ###

M2C is written in a subset of the C99 standard of C.

**There are no dependencies on any third party libraries.**


### OS support ###

M2C will run on any operating system with target support by the host-compiler.


### Development Languages ###

* M2C itself is written in a subset of C99.
* The syntax diagram generator script is written in TCL/TK (not required to build M2C)
* Build configuration scripts are written in the prevalent shell language of the hosting platform
